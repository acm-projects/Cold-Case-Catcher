# Cold-Case-Catcher üîç
Thousands of criminal cases go unsolved every year, with many not getting enough public attention or help. This web app aims to get the general public involved in these investigations by pooling resources and potentially helping find vital information to solve cold cases across the country. 

# MVP
- Pull unsolved crime data from this government created API (a database of crime returned in csv or json) 
- Create a web scraper for cases listed in the database, in order to find more information (articles, videos, podcasts, etc)
- Let users create accounts in order to collaborate with others on cases (a forum)
- Allow users to upload their own cases (questions of reliability arise)
- Display all cases in an efficient manner including:
  - Basic facts about the case
  - Articles written about the case
  - Any police reports
  - The forum
  - If desired, a contact person for the case
  - Links (or embedded) any digital media (videos, podcasts)
- Let users keep track of what cases they are watching and allow them to make private notes about each case (only seen by them)

# Stretch Goals
- Allow for picture submissions of the victim/perpetuator
- Allow users to get updated when important revelations occur in a case
- A private messaging system between users
